This is an inventory ordering reporting site for instawork pros on CAFortune shifts at wholefoods and sprouts. 
I created this inventory form because I needed specific features: 
  I need a drop down menu where people can select the store they're reporting an order for. 
  I need different inventory lists to populate for different stores. 
  Rather than seeing all 150 items listed at once, I want a search menu where people can type the product name, and that will populate the information for the product from the inventory list I uploaded to the site. 
  After they select a product, I want a quantity box to populate next to the product info for them to enter the order amount. 
  After the order amount, I want there to be two buttons "Add More" and "Review and Submit" 
  "Add More" will simply add another line where they can take the same actions. 
  "Review and submit" will show a list of everything they selected nd the amounts ordered for each item. 
  On the review page, there will be a "back" button that will take them back to adding more order information,
  or "Submit" will submit their information. What they submited will need to be added into a google excel sheet that displays all submissions. 
I would like these submissions to be timestamped.
